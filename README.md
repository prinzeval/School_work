# Auto Shop Management System

Welcome to the Auto Shop Management System! This project was developed to streamline the management processes of an auto shop, including customer information, technician details, parts inventory, vehicle records, job assignments, and invoices. The system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, ensuring that all necessary operations can be performed with ease.

## Project Overview

The Auto Shop Management System is built using Python and PyQt6, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. The system is divided into several sections, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Technician Management**: Manage technician information, including names, specialties, and hourly rates.
- **Customer Management**: Handle customer information, including names, contact details, and addresses.
- **Parts Management**: Manage the inventory of parts, including part names, unit prices, and stock quantities.
- **Vehicle Management**: Keep track of vehicle details, including customer associations and maintenance records.
- **Job Management**: Assign jobs to technicians, track job progress, and manage job details.
- **Invoice Management**: Generate and manage invoices for completed jobs and parts used.

## Key Features

- **User Roles**: The system supports multiple user roles, including Admin and Technician. Admins have full access to all features, while Technicians have limited access.
- **Data Management**: Efficiently manage data for technicians, customers, parts, vehicles, jobs, and invoices.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for specific information using the search box on the main page.
- **Image Carousel**: Display images of vehicles in a dynamic carousel on the main page.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, we deepened our understanding of database management and enhanced our skills in handling complex data structures. Here are some key takeaways from our journey:

- **Database Design**: We designed a robust database schema to store and manage various entities, ensuring data integrity and efficient access.
- **SQL Proficiency**: We improved our SQL skills by writing complex queries to fetch and manipulate data from the database.
- **Data Integration**: We learned how to integrate database operations with the GUI, providing seamless interaction between the user and the data.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control taught us the importance of securing sensitive information and providing different levels of access based on user roles.
- **Error Handling**: We developed better error handling mechanisms to ensure the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users.
